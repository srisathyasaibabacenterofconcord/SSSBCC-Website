    <h2>Our Center’s History</h2>
    <p>The Sri Sathya Sai Baba Center of Concord (SSSBCC) was founded in the late 1970s under the direct guidance of Sathya Sai Baba. It is one of the oldest centers in the United States and serves the East Bay community by providing spiritual programs, devotional activities, and community service.</p>
    <p>We organize weekly study circles, devotional gatherings, service projects, and youth programs to spread the teachings of Sathya Sai Baba and promote selfless service.</p>
