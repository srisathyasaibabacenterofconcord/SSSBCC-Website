        <h2>Who is Sathya Sai Baba?</h2>
        <p>
            Sathya Sai Baba was a revered spiritual teacher and humanitarian whose life and work have inspired millions around the world. 
            He taught that the highest purpose of life is to realize our innate divinity through love, selfless service, and right action. 
            Emphasizing the unity of all faiths, he declared that "Love is God, Live in Love," and encouraged everyone to see all religions as different paths to the same truth. 
            Beyond his profound spiritual message, Sathya Sai Baba established major humanitarian projects, including free super-specialty hospitals, free schools and universities, and massive drinking water supply systems that serve some of the most underserved regions in India. 
            His life was filled with countless acts of compassion and miracles experienced by people from all walks of life.
